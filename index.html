            <li><strong>Childhood: 1918–1934</strong>:&nbsp;Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in
                Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province.[2] Given the forename Rolihlahla,[3] a Xhosa term
                colloquially meaning "troublemaker",[4] in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.[5] His
                patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian
                Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.[6] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela,
                was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.[7] Because Mandela was the king's child by a
                wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal
                family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.

                <strong>Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940</strong>:&nbsp;Intending to gain skills needed
                to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his secondary
                education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was
                the largest
                school for black Africans in Thembuland.[25] Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he
                claimed that he
                lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing
                sports and
                developed his lifelong love of gardening.[

                <strong>Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943</strong>:&nbsp;Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940,
                Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice;
                dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.[40] Mandela found work as a
                night watchman
                at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna
                (headman)
                discovered that he was a runaway.[41] He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced
                Mandela to realtor
                and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of
                Witkin,
                Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's
                cause.[42] At the firm,
                Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish
                communist who
                became his first white friend.[43] Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed
                that Europeans,
                Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He later stated that he did not join the party because
                its atheism
                conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially
                based rather than
                as class warfare.[44] To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South
                Africa correspondence
                course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.[45]
